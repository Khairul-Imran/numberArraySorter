# numberArraySorter
The Number Array Sorter is a simple application that allows users to arrange a set of random numbers in an array in either ascending or descending order. The program employs the bubble sort algorithm to perform the sorting, providing a simple and intuitive way to organise numerical data.

## Introduction
Sorting a list of numbers is a common task in computer programming. Built-in array methods simplifies this process for programmers as they do not have to implement an algorithm to do the sorting for them. I was curious about how this was implemented under the hood, and decided to try and create my own number array sorter. This simple application allows users to input random numbers and choose whether to sort them in ascending or descending order. The application uses the bubble sort algorithm to rearrange the elements, providing a basic but effective approach to organising numerical data.

## Features
- Sorts an array of random numbers provided by the user using the bubble sort algorithm.
- Allows users to choose between ascending and descending order.
- Provides clear and user-friendly prompts.

## Usage
1. Open the project in your favourite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
2. Locate the 'Main.java' file, which contains the main method.
3. Run the 'Main.java' file to start the application.
4. Follow the prompts to input your numbers.
5. Choose whether you want the numbers to be sorted in ascending or descending order.
6. The application displays the sorted array based on your selection.

## Disclaimer
This project is a beginner-level implementation and may not be the most optimal solution. It was created as I was curious how it could be done, and I wanted to practice writing simple programs on my own and gain some exposure to some algorithms. As a result, you might encounter certain inefficiencies while using the application.
